I previously attempted a game in pygame: https://github.com/j-masci/game-1. I didn't know how to write Python or know even the first thing about coding video games. It was a good learning experience, but it's also a mess. 

Going to give it another go with a fresh start. What will it be? I have no clue.

To run:

install pygame 

```commandline
pip install pygame
```

Load play.py, preferably in an interactive prompt.

Currently, I don't know how to use the command line while the game is running, but if you close the game (and you opened with -i), then you can still inspect the game state and even open the window again and continue.

```commandline
python -i play.py
```
